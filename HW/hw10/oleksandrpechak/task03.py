# Task3. Create an employee class. Each employee has characteristics such as name and salary. 
# The class should have a counter that calculates the total number of employees, as well as a method that prints the total number of employees and
#  a method that displays information about each employee in particular, namely the name and salary.
#  In addition to creating a class, display information about the base classes 
#  from which the employee class is inherited (__base_),
# the class namespace (__dict__), the class name (_name_), the module name in which the class is defined (module_), the documentation bar (_doc_)
